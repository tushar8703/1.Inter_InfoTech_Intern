                <p>Online education, also known as e-learning or distance learning, is a method of learning where
                    students
                    access course materials and interact with instructors and peers through the internet, offering
                    flexibility and accessibility. Online learning continues to surge in popularity, not just
                    because of
                    us
                    all staying at home more in a post-Covid reality. Several factors play a part. Notably, how
                    distance
                    learning better fits modern life, especially given the average person now spends over seven
                    hours a
                    day
                    online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online learning can also reduce costs for students. And, as institutions look into how to engage
                    students in online learning, data offers invaluable information. Analysts can use this to learn
                    how
                    to
                    optimize curriculums for greater engagement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This remote style of learning is already well-embedded in workplaces. Pharmaceutical and fintech
                    companies
                    often use module-based online learning as core training. The sort of training required by their
                    regulatory
                    bodies, and necessary for staff to complete as part of their onboarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for how to do a job, getting trained on this is no longer commonplace—learning on the job is.
                    The more you can do to prepare yourself for that, with qualifications and autonomous learning, the
                    more competitive edge you’ll have. Especially when you’re job hunting.
                </p>
                <p>Tuition costs can also vary between online and on-campus programs. For instance, at Drexel
                    University, students enrolled in online programs in the School of Education receive a 25% discount
                    off the price of regular tuition. Most online programs offered by the school are also financial aid
                    eligible.</p>
